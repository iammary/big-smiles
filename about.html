## About

Hello and welcome to Big Smiles for The Little Ones! We are a small community of individuals aiming to draw smiles on children’s faces.

I am <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mlastomen">Mae Ann Lastomen</a> and we came up with this slogan after a <a href="http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/disasters/knowledge-base/41494-magnitude-visayas-earthquake-equivalent-energy">magnitude 7.2 quake</a> hit our province Bohol last October 2013. It was quite hard and the struggle to start over was real. We saw how difficult it was for communities and for families to restore what was lost. Everything was documented in the news, in videos, in photos. Children were suffering as well. It was then that we realized that it was time to step up and in a sense, make the world a better place – even just for these children.

With the cooperation of the Cabayugan Teachers, the Tayabas Clan Volunteers, my friends in Singapore and my family (my mother and siblings); we were able to make our first event in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Cabayugan-Calape-Bohol/496971720424792">Cabayugan, Calape, Bohol</a> last February 2014 a success. There were games, presentations and of course, food. We also gave out tumblers, goodie bags and toys.

Since then we have earned several sponsors who have graciously expressed support for our succeeding events. There are so many of you that I am thankful for. You all know who you are…
